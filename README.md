# Slack Emoji Pok√©mon

This project works best with [lambtron/emojipacks](https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks). No need to clone, just use the raw URLs for YAML files.

## Usage

When prompted for Path or URL of Emoji YAML file enter either of the urls below. The prefix url is advised as it prefixes `pokemon-` to every name.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/templarian/slack-emoji-pokemon/master/pokemon.yaml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/templarian/slack-emoji-pokemon/master/pokemon-prefix.yaml
```

Or the less recommended approach is to upload each by hand from the `emojis` folder.
